Welcome to my kingdom madness
You're just in time for the show
Welcome to my world of darkness
A place where unreal becomes real
Come drink my blood, wake the demon in me
Come taste the wine of my sins
Out of control
Without any fear of facing the madman
Out of control
Defying the Gods of Hell
You are out of control
You can't find a shelter in Hellspace
Under my black wings of doom
The wind in the wasteland is howling
It's the wailing of ghosts of the past
Swing 'cross the ocean of pleasure and pain
Into my fatal embrace
Out of control,
Without any fear of facing the madman
Out of control
Defying the Gods of Hell
You are
Out of control
Without any fear of facing the madman
Out of control
Defying the Gods of Hell
You are out of control, whoa yeah!
Out of control
Without any fear of facing the madman
Out of control,
Defying the Gods of Hell
You are
Out of control
Without any fear of facing the madman
Out of control,
Defying the Gods of Hell
You are
Out of control (out of control)
Out of control
